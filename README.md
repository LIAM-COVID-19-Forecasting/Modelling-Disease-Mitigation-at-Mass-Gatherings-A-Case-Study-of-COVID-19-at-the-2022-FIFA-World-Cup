## Required Packages
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- tqdm
- pingouin
- sympy (Only required to run meta_population_models\reproductive_numbers\MGE_single_population_derivation.py)


## Core ODE model and Generalisable Framework for Modelling Mass Gathering Events.
This can be found in the directory meta_population_models.

## Event Queue and Events
This can be found in event_handling.




## Analyses of Testing Strategies

Analyses_of_Testing_Strategies_Simulations.py runs simulations outlined in 
this section of manuscript. Analyses_of_Testing_Strategies_Figures.py then performs
PCC analyses and produces figures from the results of these simulations.

## Analyses of Travel Vaccination Restrictions Figures

Analyses_of_Travel_Vaccination_Restrictions_Simulations.py runs simulations outlined in 
this section of manuscript. Analyses_of_Travel_Vaccination_Restrictions_Figures.py
then produces figures from the results of these simulations.

## Derivation of Basic Reproductive Number (R_0)

This can be found in 
meta_population_models\reproductive_numbers\MGE_single_population_derivation.py
